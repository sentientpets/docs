description: "How SOL rewards are calculated and distributed to GOCHI players"
---

GOCHI distributes SOL rewards to players based on a combination of pet care quality and $TOKEN token holdings. This hybrid model rewards both active gameplay and ecosystem investment.

## Distribution Principles

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Hourly Payouts" icon="clock">
    Rewards are calculated and distributed every hour, driving frequent engagement.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Dual Factors" icon="scale-balanced">
    Rewards are based on both active pet care and $TOKEN holdings.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Transparent Formula" icon="calculator">
    All reward calculations follow a public, verifiable formula.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Reward Formula

```
Individual Reward = (UserPoints ÷ TotalPoints) × HoldingMultiplier × HourlyPool
```

Where:
- **UserPoints** = Points earned from pet care quality
- **TotalPoints** = Sum of all active users' points
- **HoldingMultiplier** = Multiplier based on $TOKEN token holdings
- **HourlyPool** = SOL rewards available for distribution each hour


## Token Holding Multiplier

The amount of $TOKEN tokens in your wallet significantly impacts your reward multiplier:

```
HoldingMultiplier = min(0.2 + (userTokens ÷ 10,000)^0.7, 8.0)
```

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Token Holdings</th>
      <th>Reward Multiplier</th>
      <th>Effect on Earnings</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0 (non-holder)</td>
      <td>0.2×</td>
      <td>-80% (minimum reward)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10,000</td>
      <td>1.0×</td>
      <td>Standard reward rate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>100,000</td>
      <td>2.0×</td>
      <td>+100% (double rewards)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1,000,000</td>
      <td>4.0×</td>
      <td>+300% (quadruple rewards)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10,000,000+</td>
      <td>8.0×</td>
      <td>+700% (maximum reward)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Note>
The multiplier uses a power function (exponent 0.7) that prevents whales from completely dominating the reward pool while still providing significant incentives for token holdings.
</Note>

## Hourly Reward Pool

The hourly reward pool is funded by the 5% transaction tax and calculated as:

```
HourlyRewardPool = (DailyVolume × 0.05) ÷ 24
```

## Distribution Mechanics

<Steps>
  <Step title="Hourly Calculation">
    Every hour, the system calculates each player's share of the reward pool based on their points and holding multiplier.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reward Notification">
    Players receive in-app notifications when new rewards are available to claim.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reward Claim">
    Players can claim their rewards with a single click, triggering a transfer of SOL to their connected wallet.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reward History">
    All claimed rewards are recorded in a transparent history viewable in the player dashboard.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Distribution Timing

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Claim Frequency" icon="clock">
    Players can claim rewards once per hour after the calculation period ends.
    
    Unclaimed rewards accumulate for up to 7 days.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Special Events" icon="calendar-star">
    Special "Power Hours" with boosted rewards occur randomly to drive engagement.
    
    Weekend reward multipliers provide 1.5× the normal rewards.
