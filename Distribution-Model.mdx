description: "How SOL rewards are calculated and distributed to GOCHI players"
---

GOCHI distributes SOL rewards to players based on a combination of pet care quality and $PURR token holdings. This hybrid model rewards both active gameplay and ecosystem investment.

## Distribution Principles

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Hourly Payouts" icon="clock">
    Rewards are calculated and distributed every hour, driving frequent engagement and creating constant excitement.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Dual Factors" icon="scale-balanced">
    Rewards are based on both active pet care (gameplay) and $PURR holdings (investment), balancing both activities.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Transparent Formula" icon="calculator">
    All reward calculations follow a public, verifiable formula that players can use to understand their earnings.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Reward Formula

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/reward-formula.png" alt="GOCHI Reward Formula Visualization" />
</Frame>

```
Individual Reward = (UserPoints ÷ TotalPoints) × HoldingMultiplier × HourlyPool
```

Where:
- **UserPoints** = Points earned from pet care quality
- **TotalPoints** = Sum of all active users' points
- **HoldingMultiplier** = Multiplier based on $PURR token holdings
- **HourlyPool** = SOL rewards available for distribution each hour

## Pet Care Quality

Your pet's state directly influences your point generation, which is a key component of the reward formula:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Care Quality Points" icon="heart-pulse">
    Points are awarded hourly based on your pet's overall health:
    
    **Excellent (≥90%):** 30 points/hour
    **Good (70-89%):** 20 points/hour
    **Average (50-69%):** 10 points/hour
    **Poor (30-49%):** 5 points/hour
    **Critical (&lt30%):** 1 point/hour
    **Dead:** 0 points/hour
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Point Weight" icon="weight-scale">
    Pet health is calculated as a weighted average:
    
    **Food:** 40% weight
    **Happiness:** 20% weight
    **Cleanliness:** 20% weight
    **Energy:** 20% weight
    
    This formula emphasizes the importance of feeding your pet while still requiring balanced care.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Token Holding Multiplier

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/holding-multiplier.png" alt="GOCHI Holding Multiplier Chart" />
</Frame>

The amount of $PURR tokens in your wallet significantly impacts your reward multiplier:

```
HoldingMultiplier = min(0.2 + (userTokens ÷ 10,000)^0.7, 8.0)
```

This creates a balanced curve that:
- Provides minimal rewards (0.2×) for non-holders
- Gives standard rewards (1.0×) at modest holdings (10,000 tokens)
- Scales up to a maximum of 8.0× for major holders (10M+ tokens)

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Token Holdings</th>
      <th>Reward Multiplier</th>
      <th>Effect on Earnings</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0 (non-holder)</td>
      <td>0.2×</td>
      <td>-80% (minimum reward)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10,000</td>
      <td>1.0×</td>
      <td>Standard reward rate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>100,000</td>
      <td>2.0×</td>
      <td>+100% (double rewards)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1,000,000</td>
      <td>4.0×</td>
      <td>+300% (quadruple rewards)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10,000,000+</td>
      <td>8.0×</td>
      <td>+700% (maximum reward)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Note>
The reward multiplier uses a power function (exponent 0.7) to create a curve that prevents whales from completely dominating the reward pool while still providing significant incentives for token holdings.
</Note>

## Hourly Reward Pool

The hourly reward pool is funded by the 5% transaction tax and calculated as:

```
HourlyRewardPool = (DailyVolume × 0.05) ÷ 24
```

  <Accordion title="Reward Pool Examples">
    | Daily Volume | Daily Rewards | Hourly Pool |

  <Accordion title="Volume Projections">
    - **Launch Phase (Weeks 1-2):** $10M-$25M daily volume

## Distribution Mechanics

<Steps>
  <Step title="Hourly Calculation">
    Every hour, the system calculates each player's share of the reward pool based on their points and holding multiplier.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reward Notification">
    Players receive in-app notifications when new rewards are available to claim.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reward Claim">
    Players can claim their rewards with a single click, triggering a transfer of SOL to their connected wallet.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reward History">
    All claimed rewards are recorded in a transparent history viewable in the player dashboard.
  </Step>
</Steps>
