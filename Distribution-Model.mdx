# Distribution Model

GOCHI distributes SOL rewards to players based on a combination of pet care quality and $PURR token holdings. This hybrid model rewards both active gameplay and ecosystem investment.

## Distribution Principles

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Hourly Payouts" icon="clock">
    Rewards are calculated and distributed every hour, driving frequent engagement.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Dual Factors" icon="scale-balanced">
    Rewards are based on both active pet care and $PURR holdings.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Transparent Formula" icon="calculator">
    All reward calculations follow a public, verifiable formula.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Reward Formula

```
Individual Reward = (UserPoints ÷ TotalPoints) × HoldingMultiplier × HourlyPool
```

Where:
- **UserPoints** = Points earned from pet care quality
- **TotalPoints** = Sum of all active users' points
- **HoldingMultiplier** = Multiplier based on $PURR token holdings
- **HourlyPool** = SOL rewards available for distribution each hour

## Pet Care Quality

Your pet's state directly influences your point generation, which is a key component of the reward formula:

## Token Holding Multiplier

The amount of $PURR tokens in your wallet significantly impacts your reward multiplier:

```
HoldingMultiplier = min(0.2 + (userTokens ÷ 10,000)^0.7, 8.0)
```

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Token Holdings</th>
      <th>Reward Multiplier</th>
      <th>Effect on Earnings</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0 (non-holder)</td>
      <td>0.2×</td>
      <td>-80% (minimum reward)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10,000</td>
      <td>1.0×</td>
      <td>Standard reward rate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>100,000</td>
      <td>2.0×</td>
      <td>+100% (double rewards)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1,000,000</td>
      <td>4.0×</td>
      <td>+300% (quadruple rewards)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10,000,000+</td>
      <td>8.0×</td>
      <td>+700% (maximum reward)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Note>
The multiplier uses a power function (exponent 0.7) that prevents whales from completely dominating the reward pool while still providing significant incentives for token holdings.
</Note>

## Hourly Reward Pool

The hourly reward pool is funded by the 5% transaction tax and calculated as:

```
HourlyRewardPool = (DailyVolume × 0.05) ÷ 24
```

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Daily Volume</th>
      <th>Daily Rewards</th>
      <th>Hourly Pool</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>$1,000,000</td>
      <td>$50,000</td>
      <td>$2,083</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$5,000,000</td>
      <td>$250,000</td>
      <td>$10,416</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$10,000,000</td>
      <td>$500,000</td>
      <td>$20,833</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Distribution Mechanics

  <Step title="Hourly Calculation">
    Every hour, the system calculates each player's share of the reward pool based on their points and holding multiplier.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reward Notification">
    Players receive in-app notifications when new rewards are available to claim.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reward Claim">
    Players can claim their rewards with a single click, triggering a transfer of SOL to their connected wallet.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reward History">
    All claimed rewards are recorded in a transparent history viewable in the player dashboard.
