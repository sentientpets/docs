## Health State Transitions

Your pet's health state changes based on your care patterns and neglect periods:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Thriving] <-->|Stats drop below 70%| B[Healthy]
    B <-->|Stats rise above 70%| A
    B <-->|Stats drop below 40%| C[Neglected]
    C <-->|Intensive care| B
    C <-->|Stats drop below 20%| D[Critical]
    D <-->|Emergency care| C
    D -->|No care for 8+ hours| E[Dead]
    E -->|Revival process| C
```

<Note>
Movement between states is not instantaneous - your pet gradually transitions as stats change. You'll receive notifications as your pet approaches negative state changes, giving you time to intervene.
</Note>

## Warning Signs to Watch For

Learn to recognize these early warnings to prevent serious health deterioration:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Appetite Changes" icon="drumstick-bite">
    If your pet becomes hungry more quickly than usual, it may indicate a developing health issue.
    
    **Watch for:** Hunger decreasing 10-15% faster than normal
    
    **Action:** Increase feeding frequency and monitor for improvement
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Activity Reduction" icon="battery-half">
    Decreased energy and lower interest in play activities often precede health problems.
    
    **Watch for:** Reduced animation speed and less enthusiastic play responses
    
    **Action:** Provide balanced care with focus on maintaining high happiness
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Visual Changes" icon="eye">
    Your pet's appearance provides important health cues.
    
    **Watch for:** Color dulling, posture changes, or unusual animations
    
    **Action:** Provide comprehensive care across all stats
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Health Emergencies

<Warning>
Health emergencies require immediate attention to prevent serious stat penalties and extended earning reductions!
</Warning>

### Critical State Management

When your pet enters a critical state (any stat below 20%):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assess Critical Stats">
    Identify which stats have fallen below critical thresholds
  </Step>
  <Step title="Address Hunger First">
    Always address hunger first - use Premium Cat Food for fastest recovery
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restore Happiness">
    Once hunger is addressed, focus on happiness recovery
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Care Cycle">
    Perform a full care cycle (feed, play, clean) to stabilize all stats
  </Step>
  <Step title="Increase Check-in Frequency">
    Double your check-in frequency for the next 24 hours
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Revival Process

If your pet reaches the death state, you'll need to complete the revival process to resume earning:

<Frame caption="The revival interface guides you through the recovery process">

</Frame>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Revival Initiation">
    When you access the app with a pet in the death state:
    
    - You'll see a recovery interface instead of the normal pet screen
    - The system will explain the revival process
    - You'll need to acknowledge the care commitment before proceeding
    
    **Important:** The revival process cannot be skipped or accelerated
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Care Commitment">
    To begin revival, you must commit to:
    
    - Checking in at least 6 times in the next 24 hours
    - Maintaining all stats above 40% during recovery
    - Completing the full revival protocol without extended absences
    
    This commitment helps ensure you're ready to provide the necessary care.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Recovery Protocol">
    The recovery involves several care cycles:
    
    1. **Initial Stabilization:** First feeding and care cycle
    2. **Waiting Period:** 1-hour observation with stats frozen
    3. **Secondary Care:** Second complete care cycle
    4. **Monitoring Period:** 4-hour period maintaining all stats above 40%
    5. **Final Assessment:** Final care cycle and system evaluation
    
    If any step fails, the process restarts from the previous checkpoint.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Post-Revival Effects">
    After successful revival:
    
    - Your pet returns with all stats at 50%
    - Decay rates increase by 20% for the next 48 hours
    - A "Recovering" indicator appears in the interface
    - Maximum earnings are capped at 2.0Ã— for one week
    
    These effects ensure that death has meaningful consequences while still allowing full recovery.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Consistency beats intensity! Regular moderate care will keep your pet healthier than sporadic intensive care. Aim for evenly spaced interactions rather than clustering care into single sessions.
</Tip>

## Health History Impact

Your pet's health history affects both its personality development and long-term traits:

| Health Pattern | Personality Impact | Stat Effects | Economic Impact |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Consistently Thriving | Confident, trusting personality | -10% decay rates | +10% earning potential |
| Mostly Healthy | Balanced, adaptable personality | Standard decay rates | Standard earning potential |
| Frequently Neglected | Anxious, needy personality | +15% decay rates | -15% earning potential |
| Multiple Deaths | Traumatized, erratic personality | +25% decay rates | -25% earning potential |

<Note>
These effects develop gradually over weeks of gameplay. Consistent care can reverse negative patterns, while even previously thriving pets can develop issues if neglect becomes common.
