## Welcome to GOCHI

Remember your Tamagotchi or Pou that demanded constant attention and gave nothing back except the guilt of virtual pet neglect? GOCHI flips the script.

Gochi is an AI-powered pixel companion on Solana that rewards care. Feed, play, and clean your GOCHI to earn SOL straight to your wallet. The better your care, the bigger your earnings.

With adaptive AI that develops a unique personality based on your interactions, GOCHI creates a compelling loop: love your pet, grow your crypto. This time, keeping your virtual friend alive might actually help pay the bills...

<Note>
  GOCHI is currently in pre-launch phase. During this period, you'll earn points that convert to \$TOKEN (Ticker TBA) tokens at launch.
</Note>

## Start Earning

During the pre-launch phase, quality care earns you points that will convert to \$TOKEN tokens at launch.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Points Earning">
    <CodeGroup>

    ```javascript Points Formula
    hourlyPoints = baseRate * qualityMultiplier * streakMultiplier
    
    // Where:
    // baseRate = 10 points per hour
    // qualityMultiplier = 0.5 (poor) to 3.0 (excellent) based on pet state
    // streakMultiplier = 1.0 + (consecutiveDays * 0.05), capped at 1.5
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    Your points earning rate depends on:

    - Overall pet stat levels
    - Consistency of interactions
    - Consecutive days of active play
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Token Conversion">
    At launch, your accumulated points will convert to \$TOKEN tokens based on your share of the total point pool:

    ```
    tokenAllocation = (yourPoints / totalPointsPool) * 150,000,000
    ```

    - 5% of total \$TOKEN supply allocated to pre-launch participants
    - Minimum allocation of 1,000 \$TOKEN for active participants
    - Maximum allocation of 500,000 \$TOKEN per wallet
    - Maximum 1000 wallets for airdrop
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Post-Launch Rewards">
    After launch, rewards shift from points to SOL:

    - 5% transaction tax funds the reward pool
    - Rewards distributed hourly based on care quality
    - Token holdings multiply your reward rate
    - Rewards claimed directly to your wallet
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
