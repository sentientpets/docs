The PURR token is allocated across several key areas:

| Allocation | Percentage | Amount | Description |
|------------|------------|--------|-------------|
| Treasury | 35% | 350,000,000 | Ecosystem growth, partnerships, and development |
| Team Allocation | 20% | 200,000,000 | 24-month linear vesting with 6-month cliff |
| Initial Liquidity | 20% | 200,000,000 | Provided at launch for trading |
| Pre-Launch Airdrop | 15% | 150,000,000 | Allocated based on points earned before launch |
| CEX Listings | 5% | 50,000,000 | Reserved for exchange listings and market making |
| Advisors & Partners | 5% | 50,000,000 | Strategic partnerships and advisors with vesting |

## SOL Rewards System

Unlike traditional tokenomics models, GOCHI separates token utility from rewards:

- $PURR is used for utility and governance within the ecosystem
- Rewards are distributed in SOL (not $PURR tokens) from the 5% transaction tax
- This creates a sustainable economic model that doesn't rely on continuous token inflation
- Holding $PURR increases your SOL reward multiplier, creating strong demand for the token

<Note>
The more $PURR tokens you hold, the higher your SOL rewards will be from pet care activities. This creates a powerful incentive to acquire and hold tokens rather than sell them.
</Note>

## Token Value Drivers
