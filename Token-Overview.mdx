## Token Allocation

The token is allocated across several key areas:

| Allocation | Percentage | Amount | Description |
|------------|------------|--------|-------------|
| Treasury | 35% | 350,000,000 | Ecosystem growth, partnerships, and development |
| Team Allocation | 20% | 200,000,000 | 24-month linear vesting with 6-month cliff |
| Initial Liquidity | 30% | 300,000,000 | Provided at launch for trading |
| Pre-Launch Airdrop | 5% | 50,000,000 | Allocated based on points earned before launch |
| CEX Listings | 5% | 50,000,000 | Reserved for exchange listings and market making |
| Advisors & Partners | 5% | 50,000,000 | Strategic partnerships and advisors with vesting |

## SOL Rewards System

Unlike traditional tokenomics models, GOCHI separates token utility from rewards:

- $TOKEN is used for utility and governance within the ecosystem
- Rewards are distributed in SOL (not $TOKEN tokens) from the 5% transaction tax
- This creates a sustainable economic model that doesn't rely on continuous token inflation
- Holding $TOKEN increases your SOL reward multiplier, creating strong demand for the token

<Note>
The more $TOKEN tokens you hold, the higher your SOL rewards will be from pet care activities. This creates a powerful incentive to acquire and hold tokens rather than sell them.
</Note>

## Token Value Drivers

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Burn Mechanics" icon="fire">
    $TOKEN tokens are permanently removed from circulation through:
    
    - Pet creation burns (post-launch)
    - Feature activation burns
    - Regular buyback and burn from tax revenue
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Utility Expansion" icon="expand">
    The utility and value of $TOKEN will grow through:
    
    - Enhanced reward multipliers
    - Exclusive features unlocked by holding
    - Governance rights over ecosystem treasury
    - Integration with broader Solana ecosystem
  </Card>

## Token Launch & Distribution

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pre-Launch Phase">
    Points-based system with no token distribution. Players accumulate points that will convert to tokens.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Genesis Event">
    $TOKEN token launch with initial liquidity providing (20%) and pre-launch airdrop (15%) distribution.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Team Vesting Begins">
    After 6-month cliff, team tokens begin linear vesting over 24 months to ensure long-term alignment.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Ecosystem Expansion">
    Strategic deployment of treasury funds for growth initiatives, partnerships, and platform development.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security Measures

To ensure transparency and security for token holders:

- Multi-signature treasury wallet requiring 3/5 signatures
- Timelock mechanisms on team token vesting
- Public dashboard showing all token movements
- Commitment to regular community updates on treasury usage
- Third-party security audits of all token-related contracts
