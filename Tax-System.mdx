GOCHI implements an 8% transaction tax on all $TOKEN token buy and sell transactions. This tax is the economic foundation of our sustainable care-to-earn model.

## Tax Breakdown

The 8% transaction tax is allocated across three key areas:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="5% Rewards" icon="gift">
    Powers the SOL rewards distributed to active players based on their pet care quality and token holdings.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="2% Liquidity" icon="water">
    Automatically adds to and deepens the token's liquidity pools, increasing price stability and reducing slippage.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="1% Development" icon="code">
    Funds ongoing development, infrastructure costs, and ecosystem growth initiatives.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How The Tax Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Transaction Occurs">
    A user buys or sells $TOKEN tokens on a decentralized exchange.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Tax is Applied">
    8% of the transaction amount is automatically withheld by the smart contract.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Tax is Distributed">
    The tax is split into three allocations: 5% to rewards, 2% to liquidity, and 1% to development.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Rewards Pool Filled">
    The 5% rewards allocation is used to purchase SOL, which enters the reward distribution pool.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Rewards Pool Mechanics

The 5% tax allocated to rewards is the lifeblood of GOCHI's care-to-earn system:

```javascript
// Example of how hourly reward pools are calculated
function calculateHourlyRewardPool(dailyVolume) {
  // 5% of all transactions go to rewards
  const dailyRewardPool = dailyVolume * 0.05;
  
  // Hourly distribution (24 hours)
  return dailyRewardPool / 24;
}

// On $5M daily volume
// $5,000,000 * 0.05 = $250,000 daily rewards
// $250,000 / 24 = $10,416 hourly rewards
```

<Note>
At $5,000,000 daily trading volume, the reward system distributes approximately $250,000 in SOL rewards daily to active players.
</Note>

## Liquidity Enhancement

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Automatic Liquidity" icon="gauge-high">
    Half of the 2% (1%) is paired with SOL and added to the liquidity pool, deepening available liquidity.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Strategic Reserves" icon="vault">
    The other half (1%) is held in reserve for strategic liquidity injections during high volatility periods.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Development Fund Utilization

The 1% development allocation is used transparently for:

| Category | Allocation | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Core Development | 40% | Server costs, contract improvements, feature development |
| Security | 25% | Audits, security testing, and monitoring |
| Marketing | 20% | User acquisition and community growth |
| Contingency | 15% | Unexpected costs and opportunities |

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Development Fund Governance">
    After the first 12 months, development fund allocation will transition to a community-governed model, where $TOKEN holders can vote on fund utilization.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Transparency Reports">
    Quarterly reports will be published detailing the use of development funds, including all expenditures and allocations.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tax Exemptions

<Warning>
There are NO tax exemptions for regular users. All buy and sell transactions incur the 8% tax to maintain ecosystem fairness.
</Warning>

The only transactions exempt from the tax are:

- Initial liquidity provision by the GOCHI team
- Token distribution to pre-launch participants
- Inter-wallet transfers (subject to daily limits)

## Tax vs. Price Impact

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Transaction Tax" icon="receipt">
    Fixed 8% on all transactions regardless of size.
    
    Directed to ecosystem functions.
    
    Applies to both buys and sells.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Price Impact" icon="chart-simple">
    Variable based on transaction size relative to liquidity.
    
    Larger trades have higher price impact.
    
    Can be minimized by using limit orders or splitting trades.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Sustainability Metrics

The tax system creates a self-sustaining ecosystem as long as:

```
Daily Volume × 0.05 ≥ Daily Reward Distribution
```

At our target minimum daily volume of $5M, the system can sustainably distribute rewards while maintaining economic balance.

<Tip>
The GOCHI tax system was designed after extensive modeling and research into successful and failed token economics models to ensure long-term sustainability.
