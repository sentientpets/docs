description: 'Earning and accumulating points during GOCHI's pre-launch phase'
---

During GOCHI's pre-launch phase, players earn points rather than tokens. These points represent your future allocation of $PURR tokens when the project officially launches.

## How Points Work

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Points Purpose" icon="bullseye">
    Points serve as a record of your early contribution and engagement with GOCHI, determining your share of the initial token allocation.
    
    Think of points as your claim ticket for the $PURR token airdrop at launch.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Points vs. Tokens" icon="scale-balanced">
    Unlike tokens, points:
    
    - Cannot be transferred between accounts
    - Have no monetary value until converted
    - Exist only within the GOCHI platform
    - Are not tradable on exchanges
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Points Generation Mechanics

Points are earned through pet care based on AI evaluation of:

- Pet state quality (health, happiness, hunger, cleanliness)
- Interaction frequency and consistency
- Activity diversity and appropriateness

### Base Point Calculation

```javascript
// How points are calculated hourly
function calculateHourlyPoints(pet, player) {
  // Base rate of points per hour
  const baseRate = 10;
  
  // Quality multiplier based on pet state (0.5 to 3.0)
  const qualityMultiplier = calculateQualityMultiplier(pet);
  
  // Streak multiplier based on consecutive days (1.0 to 1.5)
  const streakMultiplier = 1.0 + Math.min(player.consecutiveDays * 0.05, 0.5);
  
  return baseRate * qualityMultiplier * streakMultiplier;
}

// Calculate quality multiplier based on pet stats
function calculateQualityMultiplier(pet) {
  // Average of all pet stats
  const avgStats = (pet.hunger + pet.happiness + 
                    pet.cleanliness + pet.energy) / 4;
  
  if (avgStats >= 90) return 3.0;      // Excellent care
  else if (avgStats >= 70) return 2.0; // Good care
  else if (avgStats >= 50) return 1.0; // Average care
  else if (avgStats >= 30) return 0.5; // Poor care
  else return 0.2;                     // Critical care
}
```

### Quality Multiplier

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Excellent Care" icon="trophy">
    **Multiplier:** 3.0×
    
    **Requirement:** Average stats ≥90%
    
    **Example:** 10 base points × 3.0 = 30 points/hour
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Good Care" icon="thumbs-up">
    **Multiplier:** 2.0×
    
    **Requirement:** Average stats ≥70%
    
    **Example:** 10 base points × 2.0 = 20 points/hour
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Average Care" icon="check">
    **Multiplier:** 1.0×
    
    **Requirement:** Average stats ≥50%
    
    **Example:** 10 base points × 1.0 = 10 points/hour
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Streak Multiplier

The streak multiplier rewards consistent daily engagement:

```
StreakMultiplier = 1.0 + (ConsecutiveDays × 0.05), capped at 1.5
```

| Consecutive Days | Streak Multiplier | Effect on Points |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1 | 1.05× | +5% |
| 5 | 1.25× | +25% |
| 10+ | 1.5× | +50% (maximum) |

<Tip>
Logging in and caring for your pet every day builds a valuable streak multiplier. Even minimal care on busy days helps maintain your streak and earn extra points!
</Tip>

## Pre-Launch Farming Limitations

To prevent excessive rewards during pre-launch:

### Daily Points Cap

```javascript
// Daily points cap increases with consecutive activity
function calculateDailyPointsCap(player) {
  // Base cap for new players
  const baseCap = 200;
  
  // Cap increases by 20 points per active day
  const increase = Math.min(player.daysActive * 20, 300);
  
  // Maximum daily cap is 500 points
  return Math.min(baseCap + increase, 500);
}
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Daily Cap Progression">
    | Active Days | Daily Cap | Explanation |
    |------------|-----------|-------------|
    | 1 | 200 | Base cap for new players |
    | 5 | 300 | 200 + (5 × 20) = 300 |
    | 10 | 400 | 200 + (10 × 20) = 400 |
    | 15+ | 500 | Maximum daily cap |
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Daily Cap Example">
    A player with excellent care (3.0×) and a 10-day streak (1.5×):
    
    - Base earning rate: 10 points/hour
    - With multipliers: 10 × 3.0 × 1.5 = 45 points/hour
    - Potential 24-hour earnings: 45 × 24 = 1,080 points
    - With 10-day cap: Limited to 400 points/day
    
    This system rewards quality care while preventing excessive farming.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Total Pre-Launch Points Cap

```
TotalPointsCap = 10,000 + (ReferralsCount × 500), maximum 20,000
```

This allows dedicated players and effective promoters to earn more but establishes a reasonable ceiling.

<Note>
Once you reach your total points cap, you can continue playing and caring for your pet, but you won't earn additional points. Your care quality will still be tracked for gameplay progression and pet development.
</Note>

## Referral Program

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Referral Process" icon="share-nodes">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Token Conversion

When GOCHI officially launches, your points convert to $PURR tokens:

```
Individual Token Allocation = (Individual Points ÷ Total Points Pool) × 150,000,000
```

### Allocation Protections
