# Pre-Launch Points System

Before **$PURR tokens** are officially launched, **GOCHI** operates on a **points-based system** that tracks your engagement and care quality. The points you earn now determine the future allocation of tokens, rewarding active play and quality pet care.

> [!NOTE]
> **Key Concept:** The points system is the foundation of our token distribution. Instead of minting tokens immediately, we record your care activities as points. When the $PURR token is launched, your accumulated points will be converted into a proportional token allocation.

---

## Overview

The Pre-Launch Points System is designed to:
- **Encourage Continuous Engagement:** Players earn points through every interaction (feeding, playing, cleaning).
- **Measure Quality of Care:** Points reflect not just activity, but how well you care for your pet.
- **Determine Future Token Allocation:** A snapshot of your total effective points at token launch will directly correlate to your share of the $PURR airdrop.
- **Maintain Fairness & Stability:** Safety multipliers and limits are in place to prevent abuse and ensure long-term sustainability.

## Points Earning Mechanism

Players earn **base points** for each care action. Below is a summary of basic point awards:

| **Activity** | **Base Points (per Hour)** | **Condition**                          |
|--------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Feeding      | 100                        | When pet is in a normal state          |
| Playing      | 80                         | Adjusted based on pet’s mood           |
| Cleaning     | 60                         | When cleanliness is below threshold    |

### Multipliers

- **Quality Multiplier (M):** Ranges from 1.0 (average care) to 2.0 (exceptional care).
- **Streak Bonus (S):** Rewards consistent daily care:
  - 3-day streak: 1.2×
  - 7-day streak: 1.5×
  - 30-day streak: 2×
- **Token Holder Multiplier (H):** Provides a bonus for early $PURR holdings:
  
  > [!TIP]
  > **Holder Multiplier Formula:**  
  > `HolderMultiplier = min(0.2 + (userTokens / 10000)^0.7, 8.0)`  
  > For example, non-holders (0 tokens) receive 0.2×, 10,000 tokens yield ~1.0×, and the maximum bonus is capped at 8.0×.

### Effective Points Calculation

The **Effective Points** a player earns per action is calculated by:
  
EffectivePoints = BasePoints × QualityMultiplier × StreakBonus × HolderMultiplier


*Example:* If a feeding action provides:
- Base Points: 100  
- Quality Multiplier: 1.5  
- Streak Bonus: 1.2  
- Holder Multiplier: 1.5  

Then:  

EffectivePoints = 100 × 1.5 × 1.2 × 1.5 = 270 points

## Conversion to Future Token Allocation

When the $PURR token launches, the total accumulated points will be converted into a token allocation based on the proportion of each player’s effective points.

UserTokenAllocation = (UserTotalEffectivePoints / TotalEffectivePoints_AllUsers) × TotalAirdropPool


> [!WARNING]
> **Safety Mechanism:**  
> To protect the treasury, we use safety factors during conversion:
> - Adjust User Points: Multiply by **0.8**
> - Adjust Total Points: Multiply by **1.1**  
> This creates a buffer against volatility.  
> *Example:*  
> If the treasury holds a value equivalent to $100K after fees and the total points equal 1,000,000, then:  
> - Adjusted User Treasury: $100K × 0.8 = $80K  
> - Adjusted Total Points: 1,000,000 × 1.1 = 1,100,000  
> - Conversion Rate ≈ $80,000 / 1,100,000 ≈ 0.0727 USD per point  
> Thus, a withdrawal of 10,000 points would yield roughly $727 in token allocation.
