# Pre-Launch Points

During GOCHI's pre-launch phase, players earn points rather than tokens. These points represent your future allocation of $PURR tokens when the project officially launches.

## How Points Work

Points serve as a record of your early contribution and engagement with GOCHI, determining your share of the initial token allocation. Think of points as your claim ticket for the $PURR token airdrop at launch.

Unlike tokens, points cannot be transferred between accounts, have no monetary value until converted, exist only within the GOCHI platform, and are not tradable on exchanges.

## Points Generation Mechanics

Points are earned through pet care based on AI evaluation of pet state quality, interaction frequency and consistency, and activity diversity and appropriateness.

### Base Point Calculation

Points are calculated hourly using this formula:

```
HourlyPoints = BaseRate × QualityMultiplier × StreakMultiplier
```

Where:
- BaseRate = 10 points per hour
- QualityMultiplier = 0.5 (poor) to 3.0 (excellent) based on pet state
- StreakMultiplier = 1.0 + (ConsecutiveDays × 0.05), capped at 1.5

### Quality Multiplier

The quality multiplier is based on the average of all pet stats:

| Care Quality | Avg Stats | Multiplier | Points/Hour |
|--------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Excellent | ≥90% | 3.0× | 30 |
| Good | ≥70% | 2.0× | 20 |
| Average | ≥50% | 1.0× | 10 |
| Poor | ≥30% | 0.5× | 5 |
| Critical | &lt30% | 0.2× | 2 |

Pet health is calculated as a weighted average of its core attributes:
Food (40% weight), Happiness (20% weight), Cleanliness (20% weight), and Energy (20% weight).

### Streak Multiplier

The streak multiplier rewards consistent daily engagement:

| Consecutive Days | Streak Multiplier | Effect on Points |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1 | 1.05× | +5% |
| 5 | 1.25× | +25% |
| 10+ | 1.5× | +50% (maximum) |

<Tip>
Logging in and caring for your pet every day builds a valuable streak multiplier. Even minimal care on busy days helps maintain your streak and earn extra points!
</Tip>

## Pre-Launch Farming Limitations

To prevent excessive rewards during pre-launch, we implement caps on daily and total point earnings.

### Daily Points Cap

```
DailyPointsCap = 200 + (DaysActive × 20), maximum 500
```

This means:
- Day 1: Maximum 200 points
- Day 5: Maximum 300 points
- Day 10: Maximum 400 points
- Day 15+: Maximum 500 points

A player with excellent care (3.0×) and a 10-day streak (1.5×) would have a base earning rate of 10 points/hour, which with multipliers becomes 10 × 3.0 × 1.5 = 45 points/hour. Their potential 24-hour earnings would be 45 × 24 = 1,080 points, but with a 10-day cap, they would be limited to 400 points/day. This system rewards quality care while preventing excessive farming.

### Total Pre-Launch Points Cap

```
TotalPointsCap = 10,000 + (ReferralsCount × 500), maximum 20,000
```

This allows dedicated players and effective promoters to earn more but establishes a reasonable ceiling.

<Note>
Once you reach your total points cap, you can continue playing and caring for your pet, but you won't earn additional points. Your care quality will still be tracked for gameplay progression and pet development.
</Note>

## Referral Program

Referring new players provides two important benefits:

1. Increases your point earning rate by 5% per referral (up to +50%)
2. Raises your total points cap by 500 per referral (up to +5,000)

To count as a successful referral, new players must create a GOCHI account, connect their wallet, and maintain an active pet for at least 3 days.

### Milestone Rewards

Reaching referral milestones unlocks special bonuses:

| Referrals | Total Earning Boost | Cap Increase | Special Reward |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|
| 3 | +15% | +1,500 | Unique pet accessory |
| 5 | +25% | +2,500 | Rare pet background |
| 10 | +50% | +5,000 | Exclusive pet variant |

Both you and your referred friends benefit! New players who join through a referral link receive a 10% point boost for their first week.

## Token Conversion

When GOCHI officially launches, your points convert to $PURR tokens:

```
Individual Token Allocation = (Individual Points ÷ Total Points Pool) × 150,000,000
```

### Allocation Protections

To ensure fair distribution, we implement:

- Minimum allocation: 1,000 $PURR tokens for accounts with ≥100 points
- Maximum allocation: 500,000 $PURR tokens per account

### Bonus Allocations

#### Leaderboard Bonuses
- Top 10: +20% bonus allocation
- Top 100: +15% bonus allocation
- Top 500: +10% bonus allocation
- Top 1,000: +5% bonus allocation

#### Early Adopter Bonuses
- Week 1-2 participants: +20% bonus
- Week 3-4 participants: +10% bonus
- Week 5+ participants: Standard allocation

## Strategic Tips

### Daily Consistency
Log in daily to maintain your streak multiplier, even if you can only perform minimal pet care. The streak bonus compounds your earnings significantly.

### Focus on Quality
Prioritize maintaining excellent pet stats (≥90%) for the maximum 3.0× quality multiplier, as this has the biggest impact on point generation.

### Optimal Referral Strategy
Focus on referring active players who will maintain their pets, as inactive referrals won't contribute to your earning boost.

### Regular Monitoring
Check your points dashboard daily to track your progress toward caps and adjust your strategy accordingly.
