title: "Pre-Launch Points"
description: "Earning and accumulating points during GOCHI's pre-launch phase"

During GOCHI's pre-launch phase, players earn points rather than tokens. These points represent your future allocation of $PURR tokens when the project officially launches.

How Points Work

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Points Purpose" icon="bullseye">
    Points serve as a record of your early contribution and engagement with GOCHI, determining your share of the initial token allocation. Think of points as your claim ticket for the $PURR token airdrop at launch.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Points vs. Tokens" icon="scale-balanced">
    Unlike tokens, points:
    - Cannot be transferred between accounts
    - Have no monetary value until converted
    - Exist only within the GOCHI platform
    - Are not tradable on exchanges

{/* Important:  The following JavaScript code block is included for informational purposes in the documentation. 
It describes how points are calculated, but it's not directly executable within the MDX content in this way. 
For actual implementation, this logic would reside in your game's backend or frontend JavaScript code, 
not directly within the documentation.

```javascript
// How points are calculated hourly (Illustrative example - Not executable here)
function calculateHourlyPoints(pet, player) {
  // Base rate of points per hour
  const baseRate = 10;

  // Quality multiplier based on pet state (0.5 to 3.0)
  const qualityMultiplier = calculateQualityMultiplier(pet);

  // Streak multiplier based on consecutive days (1.0 to 1.5)
  const streakMultiplier = 1.0 + Math.min(player.consecutiveDays * 0.05, 0.5);

  return baseRate * qualityMultiplier * streakMultiplier;
}

// Calculate quality multiplier based on pet stats (Illustrative example - Not executable here)
function calculateQualityMultiplier(pet) {
  // Average of all pet stats
  const avgStats = (pet.hunger + pet.happiness +
                    pet.cleanliness + pet.energy) / 4;

  if (avgStats >= 90) return 3.0;      // Excellent care
  else if (avgStats >= 70) return 2.0; // Good care
  else if (avgStats >= 50) return 1.0; // Average care
  else if (avgStats >= 30) return 0.5; // Poor care
  else return 0.2;                     // Critical care
}

// Daily points cap increases with consecutive activity (Illustrative example - Not executable here)
function calculateDailyPointsCap(player) {
  // Base cap for new players
  const baseCap = 200;

  // Cap increases by 20 points per active day
  const increase = Math.min(player.daysActive * 20, 300);

  // Maximum daily cap is 500 points
  return Math.min(baseCap + increase, 500);
}
Quality Multiplier**Example:** 10 base points × 3.0 = 30 points/hour
**Example:** 10 base points × 2.0 = 20 points/hour
**Example:** 10 base points × 1.0 = 10 points/hour
