title: 'Pre-Launch Points'
description: 'Earning and accumulating points during GOCHI's pre-launch phase'
---

During GOCHI's pre-launch phase, players earn points rather than tokens. These points represent your future allocation of $PURR tokens when the project officially launches.

## How Points Work

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Points Purpose" icon="bullseye">
    Points serve as a record of your early contribution and engagement with GOCHI, determining your share of the initial token allocation.
    
    Think of points as your claim ticket for the $PURR token airdrop at launch.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Points vs. Tokens" icon="scale-balanced">
    Unlike tokens, points:
    
    - Cannot be transferred between accounts
    - Have no monetary value until converted
    - Exist only within the GOCHI platform
    - Are not tradable on exchanges
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Points Generation Mechanics

Points are earned through pet care based on AI evaluation of:

- Pet state quality (health, happiness, hunger, cleanliness)
- Interaction frequency and consistency
- Activity diversity and appropriateness

### Base Point Calculation

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/points-calculation.png" alt="GOCHI Points Calculation" />
</Frame>

```javascript
// How points are calculated hourly
function calculateHourlyPoints(pet, player) {
  // Base rate of points per hour
  const baseRate = 10;
  
  // Quality multiplier based on pet state (0.5 to 3.0)
  const qualityMultiplier = calculateQualityMultiplier(pet);
  
  // Streak multiplier based on consecutive days (1.0 to 1.5)
  const streakMultiplier = 1.0 + Math.min(player.consecutiveDays * 0.05, 0.5);
  
  return baseRate * qualityMultiplier * streakMultiplier;
}

// Calculate quality multiplier based on pet stats
function calculateQualityMultiplier(pet) {
  // Average of all pet stats
  const avgStats = (pet.hunger + pet.happiness + 
                    pet.cleanliness + pet.energy) / 4;
  
  if (avgStats >= 90) return 3.0;      // Excellent care
  else if (avgStats >= 70) return 2.0; // Good care
  else if (avgStats >= 50) return 1.0; // Average care
  else if (avgStats >= 30) return 0.5; // Poor care
  else return 0.2;                     // Critical care
}
```

### Quality Multiplier

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Excellent Care" icon="trophy">
    **Multiplier:** 3.0×
    
    **Requirement:** Average stats ≥90%
    
    **Example:** 10 base points × 3.0 = 30 points/hour
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Good Care" icon="thumbs-up">
    **Multiplier:** 2.0×
    
    **Requirement:** Average stats ≥70%
    
    **Example:** 10 base points × 2.0 = 20 points/hour
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Average Care" icon="check">
    **Multiplier:** 1.0×
    
    **Requirement:** Average stats ≥50%
    
    **Example:** 10 base points × 1.0 = 10 points/hour
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Streak Multiplier

The streak multiplier rewards consistent daily engagement:

```
StreakMultiplier = 1.0 + (ConsecutiveDays × 0.05), capped at 1.5
```

| Consecutive Days | Streak Multiplier | Effect on Points |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1 | 1.05× | +5% |
| 5 | 1.25× | +25% |
| 10+ | 1.5× | +50% (maximum) |

<Tip>
Logging in and caring for your pet every day builds a valuable streak multiplier. Even minimal care on busy days helps maintain your streak and earn extra points!
</Tip>

## Pre-Launch Farming Limitations

To prevent excessive rewards during pre-launch:

### Daily Points Cap

```javascript
// Daily points cap increases with consecutive activity
function calculateDailyPointsCap(player) {
  // Base cap for new players
  const baseCap = 200;
  
  // Cap increases by 20 points per active day
  const increase = Math.min(player.daysActive * 20, 300);
  
  // Maximum daily cap is 500 points
  return Math.min(baseCap + increase, 500);
}
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Daily Cap Progression">
    | Active Days | Daily Cap | Explanation |
    |------------|-----------|-------------|
    | 1 | 200 | Base cap for new players |
    | 5 | 300 | 200 + (5 × 20) = 300 |
    | 10 | 400 | 200 + (10 × 20) = 400 |
    | 15+ | 500 | Maximum daily cap |
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Daily Cap Example">
    A player with excellent care (3.0×) and a 10-day streak (1.5×):
    
    - Base earning rate: 10 points/hour
    - With multipliers: 10 × 3.0 × 1.5 = 45 points/hour
    - Potential 24-hour earnings: 45 × 24 = 1,080 points
    - With 10-day cap: Limited to 400 points/day
    
    This system rewards quality care while preventing excessive farming.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Total Pre-Launch Points Cap

```
TotalPointsCap = 10,000 + (ReferralsCount × 500), maximum 20,000
```

This allows dedicated players and effective promoters to earn more but establishes a reasonable ceiling.

<Note>
Once you reach your total points cap, you can continue playing and caring for your pet, but you won't earn additional points. Your care quality will still be tracked for gameplay progression and pet development.
</Note>

## Points Tracking

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/points-tracking.png" alt="GOCHI Points Tracking Dashboard" />
</Frame>

The GOCHI interface provides clear visibility into your points:

- Current points balance
- Points earned today
- Progress toward daily cap
- Progress toward total cap
- Points earning rate
- Leaderboard position

<Warning>
Your points balance and earning rate are subject to audit before the final snapshot. Any accounts showing evidence of exploitation or automation may have their points adjusted or invalidated.
</Warning>

## Referral Program

Referring new players is a powerful way to increase both your earning rate and maximum point cap.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Referral Process" icon="share-nodes">
    Share your unique referral link with friends. When they:
    
    1. Create a GOCHI account
    2. Connect their wallet
    3. Maintain an active pet for at least 3 days
    
    They're counted as a successful referral.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Referral Benefits" icon="gift">
    Each successful referral provides:
    
    - +5% to your point earning rate
    - +500 to your total point cap
    - One-time bonus of 100 points
    - Special referral achievement badges
  </Card>

</Tip>

## Token Conversion

When GOCHI officially launches, your accumulated points will be converted to $PURR tokens according to this formula:

```
Individual Token Allocation = (Individual Points ÷ Total Points Pool) × 150,000,000
```

Where:
- Individual Points = Your total accumulated points at snapshot
- Total Points Pool = Sum of all eligible players' points
- 150,000,000 = Number of $PURR tokens allocated to pre-launch participants (15% of total supply)

### Allocation Safeguards

To ensure fair distribution:

- Minimum allocation: 1,000 $PURR tokens for any account with ≥100 points
- Maximum allocation: 500,000 $PURR tokens per account (0.05% of total supply)
- Snapshot timing: Announced 48 hours in advance
- Distribution: Tokens sent directly to connected wallets within 24 hours of launch

<Warning>
To be eligible for token allocation, your wallet must have been active within 7 days of the final snapshot. Dormant accounts may be excluded from distribution.
</Warning>

## Leaderboard & Ranking

The pre-launch phase features a global leaderboard displaying the top point earners. Your position affects your token allocation.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Leaderboard Position</th>
      <th>Bonus Allocation</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Top 10</td>
      <td>+20%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Top 100</td>
      <td>+15%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Top 500</td>
      <td>+10%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Top 1,000</td>
      <td>+5%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Early Adoption Bonus

Joining early increases your token allocation:

- Week 1-2 participants: +20% bonus allocation
- Week 3-4 participants: +10% bonus allocation
- Week 5+ participants: Standard allocation

This bonus is calculated after your base allocation is determined.
