## Holding Multiplier System

Token holders receive substantial earning bonuses through the Holding Multiplier system:

| Holding Tier | Token Amount | Multiplier | Effect on Rewards |
|--------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| Non-holder | 0 $TOKEN | 0.2× | -80% reward penalty |
| Basic Holder | 10,000 $TOKEN | 1.0× | Standard rewards (baseline) |
| Committed Holder | 100,000 $TOKEN | 2.0× | Double rewards |
| Significant Holder | 1,000,000 $TOKEN | 4.0× | Quadruple rewards |
| Whale | 10,000,000+ $TOKEN | 8.0× | Eight times standard rewards |

<Note>
The Holding Multiplier applies to all rewards earned through pet care, creating a powerful compound effect when combined with excellent care quality.
</Note>

## Multiplier Formula

The multiplier is calculated using a power function that creates a balanced curve:

```javascript
// Token Holding Multiplier Formula
function calculateHoldingMultiplier(tokenBalance) {
  return Math.min(0.2 + Math.pow((tokenBalance / 10000), 0.7), 8.0);
}
```

This formula ensures that:

## Compound Effect

The holding multiplier creates a compound effect when combined with Care Quality:

    A[Total Reward] --> B[Care Quality Score]
    A --> C[Holding Multiplier]
    B --> D[Based on pet care]
    C --> E[Based on token holdings]
    D --> F[0.5× to 3.0× base rate]
    E --> G[0.2× to 8.0× multiplier]
    F --> H[Combined Multiplier]
    G --> H
    H --> I[Final Reward]
```

This dual multiplier system creates powerful incentives for both active gameplay and token investment.

## Investment Strategies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Balanced Approach">
    **Strategy:** Maintain modest token holdings while focusing on excellent care
    
    **Example:** 10,000 $TOKEN + Excellent Care (3.0×)
    = 1.0 × 3.0 = 3.0× total multiplier
    
    **Best For:** Active players with limited investment capital
    
    **ROI Potential:** ~450% annual (assuming consistent excellent care)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Token-Focused">
    **Strategy:** Prioritize acquiring significant token holdings for multiplier effect
    
    **Example:** 1,000,000 $TOKEN + Average Care (1.0×)
    = 4.0 × 1.0 = 4.0× total multiplier
    
    **Best For:** Investors who play more casually but want significant returns
    
    **ROI Potential:** ~180% annual (with just average care quality)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Maximalist Approach">
    **Strategy:** Combine large token holdings with excellent pet care
    
    **Example:** 1,000,000 $TOKEN + Excellent Care (3.0×)

    **Best For:** Dedicated players willing to make significant investment
