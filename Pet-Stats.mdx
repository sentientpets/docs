## Core Attributes

Every GOCHI pet has four primary attributes that determine its overall wellbeing and earning potential:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Hunger" icon="bowl-food">
    How well-fed your pet is
    <br />**Weight in Score:** 40%
    <br />**Decay Rate:** -30% per hour
  </Card>
  <Card title="Happiness" icon="face-smile">
    Your pet's contentment level
    <br />**Weight in Score:** 20%
    <br />**Decay Rate:** -25% per hour
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cleanliness" icon="shower">
    How clean your pet is
    <br />**Weight in Score:** 20%
    <br />**Decay Rate:** -20% per hour
  </Card>
  <Card title="Energy" icon="bolt">
    Your pet's activity level
    <br />**Weight in Score:** 20%
    <br />**Decay Rate:** -15% per hour
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Attribute Decay

<Note>
Your pet's attributes naturally decay over time, requiring regular care to maintain optimal levels.
</Note>

Each attribute decreases at its own rate when left unattended:

```javascript
const decayRates = {
  hunger: 0.3,     // 30% per hour
  happiness: 0.25, // 25% per hour
  cleanliness: 0.2, // 20% per hour
  energy: 0.15     // 15% per hour
};
```

This decay system requires 8-10 interactions within a 10-hour active period to maintain optimal pet health.

## Critical Thresholds

When attributes fall below certain levels, your pet experiences negative effects that impact earnings:

| Threshold | Time Without Care | Effect on Earnings |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Hungry | ~3.5 hours | -75% earning rate |
| Severely Hungry | ~4.25 hours | -95% earning rate |
| Death | 8-10 hours | No earnings, requires revival |

<Warning>
If your pet reaches the death state, you will stop earning completely until you revive it through the recovery process.
</Warning>

## Sleep Mode

<Accordion title="Sleep Mode Benefits">
  When activated, Sleep Mode reduces attribute decay by 70% for 6-8 hours, allowing you to maintain better pet health during overnight periods or when you can't actively care for your pet.
</Accordion>

<Tip>
Always activate Sleep Mode before extended absences to protect your earning potential.
