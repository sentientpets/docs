Your GOCHI pet thrives on proper care, with four primary attributes determining its wellbeing. Maintaining these stats doesn't just keep your pet happy – it directly impacts your earning potential.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Hunger" icon="bowl-food">
    How well-fed your pet is. This decays the fastest at **30% per hour** and has the largest impact on your pet's overall health and earnings.
    
    When hunger drops too low, your earning rate decreases dramatically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Happiness" icon="face-smile">
    Your pet's emotional wellbeing. Decays at **25% per hour** and is primarily increased through play activities.
    
    A happy pet earns more rewards and develops more positive personality traits.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cleanliness" icon="shower">
    How clean your pet is. Decays at **20% per hour** and requires regular grooming to maintain.
    
    Low cleanliness can negatively impact happiness and health over time.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Energy" icon="bolt">
    Your pet's activity level. Decays at **15% per hour** and is consumed when playing.
    
    Energy naturally replenishes over time and is required for play activities.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How Stats Affect Earnings

Your pet's overall condition directly determines your earning rate. The system weights each attribute based on its importance:

```javascript
// Weighted impact of each stat on earnings
const earningImpact = {
  hunger: 0.4,      // 40% of total score
  happiness: 0.2,   // 20% of total score
  cleanliness: 0.2, // 20% of total score
  energy: 0.2       // 20% of total score
};

// This means keeping hunger high should be your top priority!
```

The combined stat average determines your base earnings multiplier, ranging from 0.1× (critical condition) to 3.0× (excellent care).

## Attribute Decay Visualization

Each attribute naturally declines over time, requiring your attention:

</Frame>

What this means for your daily care routine:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Morning Care">
    Start your day by feeding your pet and checking all stats
  </Step>
  <Step title="Regular Check-ins">
    Plan for 8-10 interactions spread throughout your active hours
  </Step>
  <Step title="Priority Check">
    When time is limited, prioritize hunger (fastest decay, highest impact)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evening Ritual">
    Before longer absences, ensure all stats are high and activate Sleep Mode
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Critical Thresholds

Your pet experiences different states based on its stat levels, each with significant impacts on your earnings:

| State | Threshold | Time to Reach | Effect on Earnings | Visual Indicator |
|-------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Optimal | All stats >70% | Requires regular care | 3.0× base rate | Green status bars |
| Good | All stats >60% | ~2 hours without care | 2.0× base rate | Green-yellow status bars |
| Average | All stats >50% | ~3 hours without care | 1.0× base rate | Yellow status bars |
| Hungry | Hunger <40% | ~3.5 hours without feeding | 0.25× base rate (75% reduction) | Red hunger bar |
| Severely Hungry | Hunger <20% | ~4.25 hours without feeding | 0.05× base rate (95% reduction) | Flashing red hunger bar |
| Dead | Extended neglect | 8-10 hours without care | No earnings | Gray interface with revival option |

<Note>
Your pet will provide visual and notification cues as it approaches critical thresholds. Pay attention to these warnings to maintain optimal earning rates.
</Note>

## Sleep Mode Benefits

When you can't actively care for your pet, Sleep Mode is essential:
