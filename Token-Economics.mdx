# Token Economics

GOCHI's token economics model has been designed to create a sustainable care-to-earn ecosystem that rewards active players, incentivizes token holding, and maintains long-term viability.

## Economic Model Overview

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/token-economics-flow.png" alt="GOCHI Token Economics Flow" />
</Frame>

The core GOCHI economic loop functions as follows:

1. Players earn SOL rewards by caring for their pets
2. SOL rewards are funded by the 5% tax on $PURR transactions
3. Higher $PURR holdings increase SOL reward multipliers
4. This incentivizes players to buy and hold $PURR tokens
5. Token transactions generate tax revenue for rewards
6. The cycle creates a self-reinforcing ecosystem

## Sustainability Analysis

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Revenue Sources" icon="money-bill-trend-up">
    - 5% of all $PURR transactions fund rewards
    - Pet creation burns create deflationary pressure
    - 1% development tax funds ongoing improvements
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Cost Structure" icon="coins">
    - SOL rewards distributed to active players
    - Infrastructure and server costs
    - Development and marketing expenses
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Sustainability Formula

The system remains sustainable as long as:

```
Daily Transaction Volume × 0.05 ≥ Daily SOL Reward Distribution
```

This creates a mathematically sound foundation where reward distribution is always proportional to economic activity, preventing inflationary collapse.

<Tip>
Unlike many play-to-earn games that rely on continuous token emission, GOCHI's SOL rewards are directly tied to transaction activity, creating a system that can remain viable indefinitely as long as trading volume is maintained.

<Note>
Player earnings range represents the spectrum from casual players with minimal holdings to dedicated players with significant token holdings. The most active and invested players can earn at the higher end of these ranges.

## Value Accrual Mechanisms

$PURR token value is supported by multiple value accrual mechanisms:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Utility Value" icon="plug">
    $PURR tokens are required for pet creation and provide earning multipliers, creating continuous utility demand.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Burn Mechanics" icon="fire">
    Pet creation burns and strategic buyback and burn operations reduce circulating supply over time.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Holding Incentives" icon="hand-holding-dollar">
    Reward multipliers create strong incentives to accumulate and hold tokens rather than sell.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Token Burn Projections

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Total Supply: 1B] --> B[Y1 Burns: 50M]
    B --> C[Y2 Burns: 75M]
    C --> D[Y3 Burns: 100M]
    D --> E[Y4 Burns: 125M]
    E --> F[Y5: 650M Supply]
```

These projections estimate a 35% reduction in circulating supply over the first 5 years through burn mechanisms.
