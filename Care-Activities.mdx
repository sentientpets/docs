### Cleaning Strategy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Regular Maintenance">
    Use Basic Brushing for daily cleaning needs - quick and universally effective
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deep Cleaning">
    Use Luxury Bath when cleanliness is critically low or before longer absences
  </Step>
  <Step title="Personality Adaptation">
    Pay attention to how your pet responds to baths - if they dislike them, stick to more frequent brushing
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Sleep Mode

When you can't actively care for your pet for extended periods, Sleep Mode is essential for maintaining stats and protecting earnings.

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-6">
  <div>
    <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Activation Benefits</h4>
    <ul className="pl-6">
      <li>Reduces all stat decay rates by 70%</li>
      <li>Remains active for 6-8 hours</li>
      <li>Preserves minimum earning rate during inactivity</li>
      <li>Provides small happiness boost when pet wakes up</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Usage Guidelines</h4>
    <ul className="pl-6">
      <li>Activate before going to bed</li>
      <li>Use before meetings or classes lasting 3+ hours</li>
      <li>Always enable before any expected period of unavailability</li>
      <li>Ensure all stats are high before activation for best results</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<Warning>
**Critical Sleep Mode Practice**

Always enable Sleep Mode before extended absences! The 70% reduction in decay rates can mean the difference between returning to a happy pet or a critically neglected one.

For optimal results, perform a complete care cycle (feed, play, clean) immediately before activating Sleep Mode.
</Warning>

## Optimal Care Combinations

Certain activity combinations provide synergistic benefits that maximize your care efficiency:

| Combination | Activities | Benefits | Best Timing |
|-------------|------------|----------|------------|
| Complete Care | Feed → Play → Clean | Addresses all stats in optimal order | Morning and evening routines |
| Quick Recovery | Premium Food → Basic Brushing | Fast recovery from neglect | After extended absence |
| Energy Boost | Catnip Treats → Laser Pointer | Maximizes playtime potential | When happiness is priority |
| Overnight Prep | Fish → Luxury Bath → Sleep Mode | Optimal preparation for overnight | Before bed |

<Tip>
The order of activities matters! For maximum effectiveness, address hunger first, then engage in play activities, and finish with cleaning.
</Tip>

## Care Schedule Recommendations

Creating a consistent care schedule dramatically improves both your pet's wellbeing and your earnings:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Ideal Daily Schedule">
    For optimal results, aim for this care pattern:
    
    - **Morning (7-9 AM):** Complete care cycle (feed, play, clean)
    - **Mid-Morning (10-11 AM):** Quick check-in (primarily feeding)
    - **Lunch (12-1 PM):** Mid-day care cycle
    - **Afternoon (3-4 PM):** Quick check-in (primarily feeding)
    - **Evening (6-8 PM):** Complete care cycle
    - **Bedtime:** Feed + Sleep Mode activation
    
    This schedule maintains optimal stats throughout the day while accommodating typical work/school hours.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Busy Day Strategy">
    When time is limited, prioritize these critical interactions:
    
    - **Morning:** Feed + Sleep Mode if you'll be unavailable
    - **Lunch Break:** Quick feed
    - **Evening:** Complete care cycle
    - **Bedtime:** Feed + Sleep Mode
    
    This minimalist approach focuses on preventing hunger from reaching critical thresholds.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Weekend Intensive Care">
    Use weekends for relationship building and stat recovery:
    
    - More frequent check-ins (every 1-2 hours)
    - Extended play sessions to build stronger personality bonds
    - Experiment with different activity combinations
    - Focus on achieving and maintaining 90%+ in all stats
    
    Intensive weekend care can compensate for less attention during busy weekdays.
