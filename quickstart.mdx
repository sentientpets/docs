## Start Earning

During the pre-launch phase, quality care earns you points that will convert to $PURR tokens at launch.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Points Earning">
    <CodeGroup>
      ```javascript Points Formula
      hourlyPoints = baseRate * qualityMultiplier * streakMultiplier
      
      // Where:
      // baseRate = 10 points per hour
      // qualityMultiplier = 0.5 (poor) to 3.0 (excellent) based on pet state
      // streakMultiplier = 1.0 + (consecutiveDays * 0.05), capped at 1.5
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Your points earning rate depends on:
    - Overall pet stat levels
    - Consistency of interactions
    - Consecutive days of active play
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Token Conversion">
    At launch, your accumulated points will convert to $PURR tokens based on your share of the total point pool:
    
    ```
    tokenAllocation = (yourPoints / totalPointsPool) * 150,000,000
    ```
    
    - 15% of total $PURR supply allocated to pre-launch participants
    - Minimum allocation of 1,000 $PURR for active participants
    - Maximum allocation of 500,000 $PURR per wallet
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Post-Launch Rewards">
    After launch, rewards shift from points to SOL:
    
    - 5% transaction tax funds the reward pool
    - Rewards distributed hourly based on care quality
    - Token holdings multiply your reward rate
    - Rewards claimed directly to your wallet
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
