The GOCHI referral system enables you to maximize your earning potential by inviting friends and expanding the community. Each successful referral increases your point capacity and provides bonus rewards.

## How Referrals Work

  <Step title="Generate Your Referral Code">
    Navigate to the Referral section in your GOCHI dashboard and generate your unique referral code or link.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share With Friends">
    Share your referral code through social media, messaging apps, or direct communication.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Track Referrals">
    Monitor your referrals and their progress through the dedicated referral dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Earn Rewards">
    Receive bonus points as your referred friends reach specific milestones in their GOCHI journey.
  </Step>
</Steps>

</CardGroup>

## Reward Structure

Referral rewards are structured to encourage both initial sign-ups and long-term engagement:

| Milestone | Bonus Points | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Account Creation | +100 | When a friend creates an account using your referral code |
| 5-Day Milestone | +250 | When your referral maintains active care for 5 consecutive days |
| 14-Day Milestone | +500 | When your referral reaches 2 weeks of consistent engagement |

<Note>
Your referral must use your code during their initial account creation for you to receive credit. The system tracks referrals automatically once the code is applied.
</Note>

## Points Cap Expansion

Each successful referral increases your maximum points cap during the pre-launch phase:

```
TotalPointsCap = 10,000 + (ReferralsCount Ã— 500), maximum 20,000
```

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Base Cap" icon="play">
    **10,000 points**
    
    Initial cap for all players
  </Card>
  <Card title="Per Referral" icon="user-plus">
    **+500 points**
    
    Added to cap for each referral
  </Card>
  <Card title="Maximum Cap" icon="trophy">
    **20,000 points**
    
    Absolute maximum (20 referrals)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The expanded cap allows you to continue earning points beyond the standard limit, maximizing your token allocation at launch.

The Referral Dashboard provides comprehensive tracking of your referral performance:

- Total referrals sent and successful conversions
- Current status of each referral's milestone progress
- Points earned from referrals
- Remaining potential points from active referrals
- Current points cap calculation

## Referral Program Rules

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Eligibility">
    - You must have an active GOCHI account to generate a referral code
    - Referred users must be new to the platform
    - Self-referrals are not permitted and will be detected by the system
    - Multiple accounts created to abuse the referral system will be flagged
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Milestone Requirements">
    - The 5-day and 14-day milestones require consecutive days of active care
    - Days with no interaction do not count toward milestones
    - Your referral must maintain minimum care standards (at least Average care quality)
    - Milestones must be achieved during the pre-launch phase
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
Attempting to abuse the referral system through self-referrals, fake accounts, or other manipulative methods will result in disqualification from the referral program and may lead to account restrictions.
</Warning>

## Referral Strategies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Quality Over Quantity">
    Focus on referring friends who are genuinely interested in the GOCHI concept and are likely to engage consistently. One dedicated referral who reaches all milestones (+850 total points) is more valuable than several who only create accounts (+100 each).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Educational Support">
    Help your referrals understand how to care for their pets effectively. By guiding them to reach their milestones, you ensure they have a positive experience while maximizing your own bonus points.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Community Building">
    Create mini-communities of GOCHI players to encourage consistent engagement through friendly competition and knowledge sharing. This approach increases the likelihood that your referrals will reach their milestones.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Remember that referrals benefit everyone involved: you earn bonus points and cap increases, your friends get an early start in the GOCHI ecosystem, and the platform grows with engaged players who understand the concept.
